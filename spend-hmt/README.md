## Background

The Prime Minister committed central government departments in May 2010 to publish items of spending from November 2010:

NHS bodies now also publish their spend data in the same way.

Guidelines of the formats were drawn up by the HM Treasury in May 2010:

This schema is based on those guidelines.
