# Local Government schemas

These schemas are for some UK local authority datasets:

* fraud
* trade union facility time
* pay multiples

The schemas are based on the requirements of the [Local Government Transparency Code 2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-government-transparency-code-2015) and follow the [LGA's Local Transparency Guidance](http://www.local.gov.uk/practitioners-guides-to-publishing-data). However these schemas are unofficial and have not been checked or endorsed by DCLG or LGA.

For the other datasets required by the Local Government Transparency Code, please see the [official LGA schemas](http://schemas.opendata.esd.org.uk/)
